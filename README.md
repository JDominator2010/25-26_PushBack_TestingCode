- [ ] ~~Adjust turn code to account for error~~ Unnesearcy with true odometry
  - [ ] ~~After each movement store error in global variable, at start of each movement adjust set theta by the error~~
- [ ] Display position on brain screen
- [ ] Switch to true odometry:
  - [x] ~~measure true tracking center, center between side whels then across wheels.~~ (Tracking center is on the IMU)
  - [x] ~~measure true track width, front of bot, measure the distnace between the center of wheels~~  (14.25 track width)
  - [x] ~~measure true diameter of big wheels~~ (Circumfrence is: 4.0982398)
  - [x] ~~measure true diameter of small wheels~~ (Circumfrence is: 4.0982398)
  - [x] ~~meaure true tracking wheel offsets~~ (Back and forth wheel: 53mm/2.086 in., Side to side: 85mm/ 3.346 in.)
